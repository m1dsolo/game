## Introduction

Demo:

[demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c22e5a91-4854-4831-b469-1eb88cf598ba)

This is a simple game developed based on my [ECS](https://github.com/m1dsolo/wheel/blob/main/include/wheel/ecs.hpp) framework.
The game mainly relies on SDL3 and uses on almost no other external libraries.
In the process of making the game, I mainly rely on my wheel library.
Please refer to the [wheel library](https://github.com/m1dsolo/wheel) for more details.

This game is currently a survivor-like game, but I will randomly add elements that I like.
For example:
1. Construction system
2. Farming system
3. Store system
4. Multiplayer system
5. etc...

Update:
1. consumable potion

## Features

- Entity-Component-System (ECS) architecture
- Primarily uses the SDL3 library for graphics and input handling
- No external libraries except SDL3
- json configuration game information

2. Press `Space` to shoot if you have a gun selected
3. Press `R` to reload the gun if you have one selected
4. Press `ESC` to show the exit menu (then press `1` to quit, `2` to resume)
